# Usage
Make sure python is installed on your system.

Open a terminal emulator (e.g. on windows `command prompt`).

Create a python virtual env to install the necessary packages:
`python -m venv .venv`

Activate the virtual environment.

If needed modify the different scripts to use the proper directories/files.

Launch, in order:
1. `python main.py`: to generate csv files extracting the information from excel files;
2. `python merge.py`: to merge csv files;
3. `python join.py`: to join csv files.
